# Review of “From Turing and von Neumann to the Present”

This project is a comprehensive review and academic analysis of Necia G. Cooper’s 1983 article, *“From Turing and von Neumann to the Present”*, originally published in **Los Alamos Science**. The review critically explores how foundational contributions by **Alan Turing** and **John von Neumann** shaped the field of **Automata Theory** and laid the groundwork for modern computing.

---

## Project Description

The review paper highlights:
- **Turing’s theoretical models** like the Universal Turing Machine and the Halting Problem.
- **Von Neumann’s practical innovations**, such as the stored-program computer and self-reproducing automata.
- Connections between automata, information theory, biological systems, and modern complexity science.

The goal is to bridge the historical insights from 20th-century computing pioneers with **modern-day applications** in AI, quantum computing, and synthetic biology.
